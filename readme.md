##Happy Valentine's Day in 2017

In this repo, I use C++ to draw a heart shape in the command line console! The code is easy, short and fantastic:)

We blog an small artical about these codes in [**imooc.com**](http://www.imooc.com), one of the toppest MOOC website in China. You could view this blog [**here**](http://www.imooc.com/article/16359).

files [main.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main.cpp) and [main2.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main2.cpp) are based on the heart curve equation as follows:

![heart shape equation 1](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart1-equation.jpg?raw=true)

The [main.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main.cpp) draws a heart shape like this:

![main.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart-1.png?raw=true)

The [main2.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main2.cpp) draws a heart shape like this:

![main2.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart-2.png?raw=true)

The [main3.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main3.cpp) is based on another different heart curve equation. The equation is as follows:

![heart shape equation 2](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart2-equation.jpg?raw=true)

And the result of [main3.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main3.cpp) is like this:

![main3.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart-3.png?raw=true) 

Inspired by @甲铁城的卡巴司机 in my class group, I added two more examples - [main4.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main4.cpp) and [main5.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/main5.cpp). Both of them fill the heart shape with characters, using above two heart shape equations. The effects look like as follows:

![main4.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart-4.png?raw=true)

![main5.cpp](https://github.com/liuyubobobo/heart-curve-cplusplus/blob/master/Resources/heart-5.png?raw=true)

Please enjoy!
